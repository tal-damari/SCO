# SCO - Self checkout system - Software Engineer course project
SCO - self checkout system based on AI

**NOTE - IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE FILE YOU NEED TO OPEN IT THROUGH ITEMIS (YAKINDU) IN YOUR COMPUTER AND RUN IT**

This system is based on self checkout system. 
What we wanted to implement is a new way to use the self checkout machine, using AI.
We made a State Chart, that includes the AI itself, regular machine (in case something goes wrong with the AI system while it runs)
and also implemented the coupon state alongside with the payment method, receipt and deleting items.

We also implemented errors, in case something goes wrong with the coupon, payment method, machine goes off in case of no electricy etc.

During this semester we were asked to make a small machine but we wanted to implement a big machine that can cover all states it can have, while making a new innovation that right now is only on its start in Taiwan
